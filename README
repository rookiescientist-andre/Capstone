The Wall Street Journal recently released their annual airline rankings report, where United Airlines dropped out of the top five. Now at #6, due to a variety of issues including plane troubles (i.e., the Boeing 737s over the last 8 years), the company’s executive team decided to tackle the issues with growing delays to regain consumer confidence. I’ve been hired to create an algorithm that can predict flight delays, which will be deployed as an app for consumers to be able to track their flights. This is important for both the airline and potential passengers – for the airline, it will help with flight logistics and reduce fees due to delays (i.e. tarmac fees, reimbursements, etc.). For passengers, the app will allow them to make delay arrangements and take measures ahead of time, and possibly save on delay expenses. While delays are frustrating whether expected or not, United aims to use this strategy to display company honesty and gain more control over their flights.
